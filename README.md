# samsung_media
/system/media/audio
from Samsung Galaxy S4 and S8+

note that there are sometimes newer/older variation,
for example `Highlight.ogg` and `Highlight (2).ogg`.
the `(2)` is the older one (from Galaxy S4).

keep you favorite, if you want the second variation,
delete `Highlight.ogg` and rename `Highlight (2).ogg` to `Highlight.ogg`.

you need to modify the premissions to `0644` and owner/group to `(0) root` as explained in `http://icompile.eladkarako.com/android-custom-ringtone/`, and after two reboots it will be available in the ringtone selection screen(s).
